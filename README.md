# AP_Assignments

Please open the AP_Assignments-master folder as a project as I have made seperate files for each class, to run the code, you need to run the class named Main.

I used hashmaps so that I could get direct access to the array list of slots corresponding to a given vaccine name, hospital corresponding to a given pincode, etc
Also I used array lists so that I dont have to worry about the number of elements I need to store.
