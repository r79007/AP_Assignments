# AP_Assignments

Please open the AP_Assignments-master folder as a project as I have made seperate files for each class, to run the code, you need to run the class named Main.

I used hashmaps so that I could get direct access to the array list of slots corresponding to a given vaccine name, hospital corresponding to a given pincode, etc
Also I used array lists so that I dont have to worry about the number of elements I need to store.

In the assignment 2, the answer to the quiz is one word, but since we only had to handle the .zip and .mp4 cases, I did not handle the more than one word answer case.
Although if I would have just changed it to sc.next() it would have handeled that, but that error does not need to be handeled so I did not handle it. Also the filenames are always spaced using '_' not by ' ' so I have considered them as one word
